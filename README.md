This is an html app used to do a side-by-side comparison of angular-translate and angular-localization.  It was used to evaluate which library would be used in Keycloak.

Just download and open index.html to run it.

Currently, the angular-localization page works but the angular-translate page is broken.  

I was trying out some advanced features of angular-translate and I never got around to finishing.  However, it used to work using language bundles statically defined in login-module-ng-translate.js.  It's still useful to see how things fit together.
